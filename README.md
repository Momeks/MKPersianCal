In order for this module to do you any good, you should write your
file header comments in a way that make-readme-markdown.el
understands. An attempt has been made to support the most common
file header comment style, so hopefully you shouldn't have to do
anything...

* ';;;' at the beginning of a line for a header.
* ';;`' at the beginning of a line for a code line.
* 'o' at the beginning of a line for a list item

If there's some more syntax you would like to see supported, just
drop me a line: mitch.special@gmail.com
